Welcome to infotainment without training wheels. Our system runs on Linux, which means it’s open, customizable, and gloriously free of gatekeepers. No hidden permissions, no “you can’t do that,” just pure control at the heart of your car.

Linux isn’t just running the servers of the world—it’s now running your dashboard. You get a rock-solid, modular system that bends to your needs instead of boxing you in. Want to tweak the interface? Go for it. Want to run apps your way? Done. Want your car’s brains to be as hackable and free as your laptop? Say hello.

This is infotainment powered by penguins, not corporations. Built on freedom, sustained by community, and ready to outlast anything proprietary. It’s not just software—it’s a movement, rolling on four wheels. 🐧🚗


Side note: it also lets you tune your car to your needs. Side-side note: in the future, someone could even build a fully open-source FSD to integrate right in.”
